# Text-classification
This project implements some classic network architectures for text classification tasks, such as DPCNN, TextRNN, TextCNN, etc. The code is highly modular and can be trained with your own dataset.

# environment
  - Python 3.x
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - tqdm
  - Gensim (for handling word embeddings)
  - Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
